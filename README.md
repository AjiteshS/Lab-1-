## My favourite thing that I have written. 
My name is Ajitesh Sharma. I am a second year Business Technology Management Student at Wilfrid Laurier University. Although I love being a student at Laurier, I didn't always see myself as a Laurier student. While applying to different universities, we often had to make supplementary applications relating to prompts provided or based on previous experience with a given university. 

One of my applications revolved around an indiviudal whom I idolised. Being a massive Drake fan, I chose to write about why I idolised Drake. I talked about his "out of the box" marketing techniques, his music, and his pride for being Canadian. Although I did not end up being accepted to the school, I was quite proud of what I had wrote.
